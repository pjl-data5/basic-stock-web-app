# basic-stock-web-app
Streamlit web app to view certain assests. Can manually select dates.

Still a work in progress. Idea is to create a protofolio management dashboard that also scrapes Yahoo Finances blog posts so that one might get an idea of the sentiment regarding certain assets. The latter works especially for ABG (give time to load). 

To run as a local host:
Save the code as is. Make sure all packages are installed. Run the code. Run the following to view in browser:
!streamlit run "basic st dashboard.py"
