Streamlit web app to view certain assests. 

Still a work in progress. Idea is to create a protofolio management dashboard that also scrpaes Yahoo Finances blog posts so that one might get an idea of the sentiment regarding certain assets.

To run as a local host:
Save the code as is. Make sure all packages are installed. Run the code. Run the following to view in browser:
!streamlit run "basic st dashboard.py"
